# Unit 7 - Creative Animation with The Theater Project

## Introduction

For this project, you will create an animation using The Theater that portrays a personal interest or solves a problem that you choose. Your program should demonstrate the object-oriented programming and software engineering skills and knowledge you have developed throughout the year.

## Requirements

Use your knowledge of object-oriented programming, data structures, and algorithms to create an animation using The Theater:

- **Use inheritance and polymorphism** – Create a superclass that represents shared attributes and behaviors with at least two subclasses that are more specific versions or variations of the superclass.
- **Method decomposition** – Use overloaded, overridden, and private methods to implement different versions of the same behavior, variations of a superclass behavior, and to improve code organization.
- **Use at least two data structures** - Use at least two 1D or 2D arrays or ArrayLists to store elements that are manipulated using loops and conditionals.
- **Implement one or more algorithms** – Implement one or more algorithms that use loops and two-way or multi-selection statements with compound Boolean expressions to analyze the data.
- **Create a visualization** – Create an animation that portrays a personal interest or solves a problem that you choose using objects, data structures, and methods.
- **Document your code** – Use comments to explain the purpose of the methods and code segments and note any preconditions and postconditions.

## Project Description

Throughout my childhood continuining through the present, I have always had an interest in sports in particular basketball. I grew up watching the Lakers with my Dad, hearing him scream at the TV when the Lakers were consistently underperforming. My introduction to the game and me learning how to play it contributed greatly to my enjoyment of the game. As I continued to pursuit it through high school it became more stressful and less enjoyable. After being on the basketball team, I decided to quit my senior year. This project was a sort of creative outlet for me to explore one of my interests and hobby's through coding. As a coder I wondered how I could effectively create an animation involving basketball. I got the idea for my animation from a basketball videogame I play on my laptop sometimes with a friend.
